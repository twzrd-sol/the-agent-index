# The Agent Index

Infrastructure for AI agents. Tools an agent reaches for mid-workflow to do its job.

Maintained as the source of truth for [The Builder Weekly's](https://thebuilderweekly.com) Agent Index page. Contributions welcome — see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## The bar

A tool earns a place in this list if an agent can use it end to end through a fully programmatic path. No human-only steps with no API or CLI equivalent. No KYC, no carrier compliance reviews, no manual dashboard configuration.

The full inclusion criterion is in [STANDARDS.md](./STANDARDS.md).

## LLM Inference (8)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

The substrate of agent operation. Every agent needs a model to call, and the models that ship as agent-callable APIs are listed here. The bar is API-key-only access — humans create the account, agents do everything else. This is the only category in the Index that gets a pass on the strict programmatic-path test, because excluding LLM inference would make the Index nonsensical.

<summary>Anthropic API - <strong>Claude models via REST API</strong> - <a href="https://anthropic.com">Website</a></summary>

Claude models (Sonnet, Opus, Haiku) via REST API with native tool-use, extended thinking, and MCP support.

The default model for most agent workflows in 2026. Strong tool-use, reliable structured output, and a context window that holds up through 200k tokens instead of degrading past 50k. First-class MCP integration makes Claude the easiest frontier model to wire into agentic systems, and the hardest to regret when an agent needs to pick a tool and commit.

<summary>Google Gemini API - <strong>Gemini models with multimodal</strong> - <a href="https://ai.google.dev">Website</a></summary>

Gemini 3 Pro and Flash models with native multimodal input, 2M token context, and image generation.

The model to reach for when the job involves images, video, audio, or very long documents. Gemini 3 Pro Image is the cleanest 4K editorial illustration model currently shipping, and the 2M context window is a genuine unlock for agents reasoning over a whole codebase or a year of transcripts at once. Multimodal-first by design, which shows the moment a task stops being text-only.

<summary>Groq - <strong>Ultra-low-latency LLM inference</strong> - <a href="https://groq.com">Website</a></summary>

Ultra-low-latency inference for open models (Llama, Mixtral, Qwen) on custom LPU silicon.

When you need token latency measured in milliseconds, not hundreds of milliseconds, Groq is it. Agents that drive voice interfaces, real-time UIs, or tight inner loops reach for Groq because the speed unlocks interaction patterns that don't work on slower infra. Model selection is narrower than the frontier providers; that trade-off is the point.

<details>
<summary>OpenAI API - <strong>GPT models and embeddings</strong> - <a href="https://openai.com/api">Website</a></summary>

GPT-4 class models, embeddings, image generation, and the Responses API via REST.

Still the default for a lot of production agents. Embeddings are cheap and reliable, the Responses API finally gives agents a clean way to manage state across turns, and the function-calling shape is the one every other provider copied. Not always the best model for reasoning, but always the most compatible.

<details>
<summary>OpenRouter - <strong>Unified API for 300+ models</strong> - <a href="https://openrouter.ai">Website</a></summary>

OpenAI-compatible router that exposes hundreds of frontier and open models behind one API key, one URL, and one pricing surface.

Useful when an agent needs to swap models without rewiring its caller. OpenRouter sits in front of Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Meta, Mistral, Qwen, DeepSeek, and the long tail in the same OpenAI-compatible shape, so the same prompt can be tried against five providers in a single change. Aggregator economics mean the price is sometimes higher than going direct, but the routing overhead is worth it for agents that pick the cheapest model that clears a benchmark on a per-task basis.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Together AI - <strong>Hosted open model inference</strong> - <a href="https://together.ai">Website</a></summary>

Hosted inference for hundreds of open models plus dedicated endpoints and fine-tuning.

The default when you want to run a specific open model in production without standing up your own GPU fleet. Model catalog is deep, the pricing is predictable, and fine-tuning is available for cases where a prompt isn't enough. Agents call it exactly like they call OpenAI, which keeps the integration layer simple.

<summary>Cerebras Inference - <strong>Wafer-scale ultra-fast LLM inference</strong> - <a href="https://www.cerebras.ai/inference">Website</a></summary>

OpenAI-compatible inference for open models on Cerebras' wafer-scale silicon, with sustained throughput in the thousands of tokens per second.

When latency is the constraint and the inner loop has to feel instant, Cerebras is the one provider shipping the numbers in production. Llama, Qwen, and the smaller frontier-adjacent models run at 2,000+ tok/s, which collapses the gap between "the agent is thinking" and "the agent is responding." The model catalog is narrower than the frontier APIs by design; that trade-off is the point.

<summary>Mistral La Plateforme - <strong>European frontier models via REST</strong> - <a href="https://mistral.ai/">Website</a></summary>

Mistral's hosted API for the Mistral Large, Codestral, and the Ministral family, with structured output, function calling, and embeddings on the same surface.

The model catalog to reach for when the choice has to be European-jurisdiction or when Codestral's code-specific tuning is the right tool for the job. La Plateforme's pricing is competitive on the mid-tier, and the function-calling shape matches OpenAI's closely enough that an agent already wired to GPT can swap in with minimal change. Strong Apache 2.0 release cadence on the open-weight side too, which keeps the option of self-hosting alive.

## Memory (4)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

Tools that give agents persistent state across sessions. An agent writes what it learned, retrieves it later by meaning rather than by keyword, and updates or deletes it programmatically. Excludes general-purpose databases — those are infrastructure, not memory layers. The bar is a managed or self-hostable service designed specifically for agent memory patterns, not a wrapper around a key-value store.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Cognee - <strong>Knowledge graph memory for agents</strong> - <a href="https://cognee.ai">Website</a></summary>

Open-source memory layer that builds a queryable knowledge graph from an agent's accumulated context, replacing flat vector retrieval with structured semantic recall.

Useful when an agent's accumulated context becomes large enough that flat vector retrieval starts surfacing noise. Cognee ingests documents, conversations, and outputs into a typed knowledge graph, so retrieval can follow real relationships instead of guessing from cosine similarity. The Python library is the primary surface, with self-host and managed cloud both available; the source is permissive enough to keep the lock-in story honest.

**Integration:** Python Library · **Homepage:** [Cognee](https://cognee.ai) · **Docs:** [https://docs.cognee.ai](https://docs.cognee.ai) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee](https://github.com/topoteretes/cognee) · **Open source**

<details>
<summary>Letta - <strong>Stateful agent memory platform</strong> ⭐ 22.0k - <a href="https://github.com/letta-ai/letta">GitHub</a></summary>

Stateful agent platform with persistent memory, context management, and a REST API for agent servers.

The team that shipped MemGPT turned it into a platform. Letta lets you spin up a stateful agent as a REST endpoint, and the agent keeps its memory across turns without you having to thread state manually. Useful when the thing you are building is an agent, not a pipeline that calls a model.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [Letta](https://letta.com) · **Docs:** [https://docs.letta.com](https://docs.letta.com) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/letta-ai/letta](https://github.com/letta-ai/letta) · **Open source**

<details>
<summary>Mem0 - <strong>Persistent memory for agents</strong> ⭐ 52.7k - <a href="https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0">GitHub</a></summary>

Persistent memory layer for AI agents with user-scoped storage, semantic recall, and fact extraction.

Persistent memory primitives for agents, with semantic recall and user-scoped storage. Agents get a place to write what they learned about a user or session and retrieve it by meaning rather than keyword. The managed version is fast enough that memory reads don't visibly slow an agent loop, and the open-source core makes self-hosting a real option for teams that need it.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [Mem0](https://mem0.ai) · **Docs:** [https://docs.mem0.ai](https://docs.mem0.ai) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0](https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0) · **Open source**

<details>
<summary>Zep - <strong>Temporal knowledge graph memory</strong> ⭐ 4.4k - <a href="https://github.com/getzep/zep">GitHub</a></summary>

Long-term memory for AI agents built on a temporal knowledge graph (Graphiti).

Where Mem0 treats memory as facts in a database, Zep treats it as a graph of entities and relationships over time. Agents that need to reason about how things changed, not just what is currently true, reach for Zep. The Graphiti engine under the hood is a real piece of engineering.

**Integration:** Python Library · **Homepage:** [Zep](https://getzep.com) · **Docs:** [https://help.getzep.com](https://help.getzep.com) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/getzep/zep](https://github.com/getzep/zep) · **Open source**

## Vector Stores (5)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

Retrieval databases that store embeddings and return semantically similar results. The foundation of retrieval-augmented generation and the most common piece of agent infrastructure after the LLM itself. Listed tools must be API-key accessible without a manual setup phase and must support both write and query operations through the same key. Self-hostable open-source options are welcomed alongside managed services.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Chroma - <strong>Open-source embedding database</strong> ⭐ 27.4k - <a href="https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma">GitHub</a></summary>

Embedded and hosted vector database with a simple Python-first API, popular for RAG prototyping.

The shortest path from zero to a working RAG loop. Chroma starts as an embedded Python library, and you can graduate to their hosted service without changing your code when the prototype turns into a product. Not every agent needs this path, but the ones that do save a week of plumbing.

**Integration:** Python Library · **Homepage:** [Chroma](https://trychroma.com) · **Docs:** [https://docs.trychroma.com](https://docs.trychroma.com) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma](https://github.com/chroma-core/chroma) · **Open source**

<details>
<summary>Pinecone - <strong>Managed vector database</strong> - <a href="https://pinecone.io">Website</a></summary>

Fully managed vector database with serverless indexes, hybrid search, and metadata filtering.

The managed option most teams start with when they need vector search and do not want to operate a database. Serverless indexes removed the biggest operational pain, and hybrid search means you can mix semantic recall with keyword and metadata filters without running two systems. Not the cheapest at scale; almost always the fastest to ship.

<details>
<summary>Qdrant - <strong>Rust-based vector search engine</strong> ⭐ 30.2k - <a href="https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant">GitHub</a></summary>

Rust-based vector search engine with strong filtering, sparse vector support, and a managed cloud.

Fast, honest, and easy to run yourself. Qdrant is written in Rust, which is not the reason to pick it, but the result is that self-hosting is a single binary. Filtered search is a first-class citizen, which matters when your agent needs to scope a query to a specific user, tenant, or time window.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech) · **Docs:** [https://qdrant.tech/documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) · **Open source**

<details>
<summary>Turbopuffer - <strong>Object-storage vector database</strong> - <a href="https://turbopuffer.com">Website</a></summary>

Object-storage-native vector database designed to store billions of vectors cheaply on S3.

The pricing model alone is worth the category. Turbopuffer keeps the index on object storage and hydrates shards on demand, which means you can store billions of vectors for a tenth of what a hot-memory database costs. Agents that need massive long-tail recall over old data without paying for it every second reach for this.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [Turbopuffer](https://turbopuffer.com) · **Docs:** [https://turbopuffer.com/docs](https://turbopuffer.com/docs)

<details>
<summary>Weaviate - <strong>Open-source vector database</strong> ⭐ 16.0k - <a href="https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate">GitHub</a></summary>

Open-source vector database with native hybrid search, multi-tenancy, and generative modules.

Open source that is actually operable. Weaviate ships with multi-tenancy built in, which matters the moment you have more than one customer sharing infrastructure. The generative modules mean you can push more of the RAG pipeline into the database; your agent just asks for the answer instead of fetching chunks and composing them.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [Weaviate](https://weaviate.io) · **Docs:** [https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate](https://github.com/weaviate/weaviate) · **Open source**

## Voice and Speech (5)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

APIs that turn audio into text or text into audio. Agents that operate on phone calls, voicemails, podcast transcripts, or voice interfaces need transcription and synthesis as primary capabilities. The bar is real-time or near-real-time API access through a single key, with no carrier compliance, no business verification, and no domain configuration required for first use.

</details>

<details>
<summary>AssemblyAI - <strong>Speech intelligence and transcription</strong> - <a href="https://assemblyai.com">Website</a></summary>

Speech intelligence API with transcription, speaker diarization, sentiment, and topic extraction.

When the job is not just transcription but understanding what is in the audio. AssemblyAI ships diarization, sentiment, and topic extraction as first-class outputs, so an agent can skip the post-processing step and act directly on structured audio metadata. Useful for meeting recap bots, call analysis, and anything that needs to know who said what.

<summary>Cartesia - <strong>Sub-100ms streaming TTS</strong> - <a href="https://cartesia.ai">Website</a></summary>

State-space-model TTS with sub-100ms first-token latency and streaming voice synthesis.

Sub-100ms first-token TTS, which is the latency floor for synthesis that feels like conversation instead of announcement. Sonic's voices are not quite as rich as ElevenLabs at the top end, but real-time agent interaction needs low latency more than it needs studio polish. When the alternative is waiting 600ms for the reply to start, Cartesia is the answer.

<summary>Deepgram - <strong>Real-time speech-to-text</strong> - <a href="https://deepgram.com">Website</a></summary>

Speech-to-text and text-to-speech APIs tuned for low latency and real-time agent pipelines.

The STT pipeline that can actually keep up with a live agent loop. Deepgram Nova is accurate enough for real transcripts, fast enough for streaming, and the pricing is sensible at volume. Agents wiring voice interfaces reach for Deepgram because the round-trip budget is already tight and they cannot afford to spend it on a slow ASR.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [Deepgram](https://deepgram.com) · **Docs:** [https://developers.deepgram.com](https://developers.deepgram.com)

</details>

<details>
<summary>ElevenLabs - <strong>Voice cloning and synthesis</strong> - <a href="https://elevenlabs.io">Website</a></summary>

High-fidelity voice synthesis with voice cloning, streaming TTS, and a conversational agent API.

The voice synthesis most humans cannot tell from a human. When an agent has to say something and the stakes are real (outbound call, read a report aloud, narrate a product experience), ElevenLabs is the default. The conversational API is the cleanest path to a voice agent that does not sound like a voice agent.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [ElevenLabs](https://elevenlabs.io) · **Docs:** [https://elevenlabs.io/docs](https://elevenlabs.io/docs)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Vapi - <strong>End-to-end voice agent platform</strong> - <a href="https://vapi.ai">Website</a></summary>

A voice agent runtime that wires STT, LLM, and TTS together behind a single API. Define an assistant, attach tools, attach a system prompt, and Vapi handles the WebRTC session, turn-taking, and barge-in.

The fastest path from "I want a voice agent" to "users are talking to a voice agent." Vapi is a platform, not a primitive — agents that want to be in a phone call, on a web page, or running through a Twilio number end up reaching for it because nothing else compresses that stack into one API surface. Phone-number provisioning is the one place a builder bumps into telecom complexity; everything else stays inside the Vapi API.

## Browser Automation (5)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

Infrastructure for agents to act on websites that don't have APIs. The agent drives a real browser, fills forms, clicks buttons, scrapes structured data, and returns results. Listed tools must let the agent control the browser through a programmatic interface from the first call, without manual fingerprinting setup, manual proxy configuration, or human approval for the use case.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Browserbase - <strong>Headless browser infrastructure</strong> - <a href="https://browserbase.com">Website</a></summary>

Managed headless browser infrastructure for AI agents with session recording, live view, and stealth.

Agents need browsers the same way humans need browsers, and running Chromium yourself at scale is miserable. Browserbase takes over the infrastructure entirely and gives you a session handle, a live view for debugging, and stealth mode that actually works against bot detection. When an agent needs to use a website nobody built an API for, start here.

**Integration:** SDK · **Homepage:** [Browserbase](https://browserbase.com) · **Docs:** [https://docs.browserbase.com](https://docs.browserbase.com)

</details>

<details>
<summary>Stagehand - <strong>Natural-language browser automation</strong> ⭐ 22.0k - <a href="https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand">GitHub</a></summary>

High-level browser automation library that lets agents describe actions in natural language.

Stagehand is what happens when you stop writing Playwright selectors and let the agent describe the action instead. You call act('click the login button'), and Stagehand figures out which element that is. From Browserbase but open source, and the model cost is low enough that the ergonomics pay for themselves.

**Integration:** TypeScript Library · **Homepage:** [Stagehand](https://stagehand.dev) · **Docs:** [https://docs.stagehand.dev](https://docs.stagehand.dev) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand](https://github.com/browserbase/stagehand) · **Open source**

<summary>Steel Browser - <strong>Open-source browser API</strong> ⭐ 6.8k - <a href="https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-browser">GitHub</a></summary>

Open-source browser API for AI agents with session persistence, proxies, and CAPTCHA handling.

The open-source answer to Browserbase. Run it yourself, wire it into your agent, get session persistence and CAPTCHA solving without paying per-session. If you need browser automation in a private network or at a price point that will not scale linearly with usage, Steel is the move.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [Steel Browser](https://steel.dev) · **Docs:** [https://docs.steel.dev](https://docs.steel.dev) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-browser](https://github.com/steel-dev/steel-browser) · **Open source**

<details>
<summary>Hyperbrowser - <strong>Cloud browser sessions for agents</strong> - <a href="https://hyperbrowser.ai">Website</a></summary>

Managed Chromium sessions an agent drives over CDP, with built-in proxy rotation, CAPTCHA handling, and session persistence.

Sits in the same lane as Browserbase but pushes more of the underlying browser surface (cookies, local storage, request interception) into the free tier. Pricing trends aggressive on session-minutes, which matters when an agent is doing dozens of short visits per task. The fingerprinting and proxy stack is good enough that scraping behind soft bot-detection works without extra plumbing.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Skyvern - <strong>LLM-driven browser automation</strong> - <a href="https://skyvern.com">Website</a></summary>

Open-source browser automation where the LLM reads the rendered page and decides the next click instead of running a brittle Playwright script.

Skyvern automates the kind of web tasks that historically needed a maintained Playwright suite. The agent navigates by reading the rendered DOM, identifying what it needs, and acting, which is how it survives layout changes that would crash a static selector script. The hosted REST API and the self-host path both exist, and the open source license keeps the lock-in story honest for teams that want to run it themselves.

## Code Execution (4)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

Sandboxed environments where agents can run code they wrote without breaking the host system. Agents that write Python, run shell commands, or execute generated scripts need somewhere safe to do it. The bar is API-key access to a clean execution environment, with results returned through the same API and no manual sandbox configuration required between runs.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Daytona - <strong>Dev environments for agents</strong> ⭐ 72.3k - <a href="https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona">GitHub</a></summary>

Open-source development environments on demand for AI agents to read, edit, and execute codebases.

Where E2B is for running code, Daytona is for giving an agent a full development environment. Fresh workspace, cloned repo, language servers ready, sandboxed from the host. When the agent is a coding agent and the task is multi-file changes against a real codebase, Daytona is the substrate.

**Integration:** CLI · **Homepage:** [Daytona](https://daytona.io) · **Docs:** [https://www.daytona.io/docs](https://www.daytona.io/docs) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona](https://github.com/daytonaio/daytona) · **Open source**

<details>
<summary>E2B - <strong>Cloud code sandboxes</strong> ⭐ 11.7k - <a href="https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b">GitHub</a></summary>

Secure cloud sandboxes for AI agents to run code, render files, and execute long-running processes.

The first code sandbox that felt like it was designed for agents, not humans. Agents spin up a sandbox, run untrusted code, render outputs, and tear it down without touching your infra. E2B is the reason code-interpreter style loops are practical in production; the alternative was running a container yourself.

**Integration:** SDK · **Homepage:** [E2B](https://e2b.dev) · **Docs:** [https://e2b.dev/docs](https://e2b.dev/docs) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b](https://github.com/e2b-dev/e2b) · **Open source**

<details>
<summary>Modal - <strong>Serverless Python and GPUs</strong> - <a href="https://modal.com">Website</a></summary>

Serverless cloud platform for running Python functions, GPU jobs, and containers on demand.

Modal turned serverless Python into something you can actually build agents on top of. Agents can call a Modal function the same way they call any other API, and the function runs on a container with GPUs attached if it needs them. Cold starts are fast enough to hide, and the pricing matches what the function actually did.

<details>
<summary>Riza - <strong>Sandboxed code interpreter API</strong> - <a href="https://riza.io">Website</a></summary>

Secure code interpreter API for LLM-generated code with fast-start sandboxes and memory isolation.

The focused answer to one narrow question: how do I let the model run the code it just wrote without it escaping and burning down my infra? Riza is a sandbox, not a development environment, and that narrowness is the point. Sub-second starts, strict isolation, a tight API surface you can wire into a tool call in five minutes.

## Web Search and Retrieval (5)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

Search APIs and content extraction tools that turn the open web into structured input for agents. Distinct from agent-built browser automation in that these are pre-built indexes, not real-time scraping. Listed tools must return results through a single API call with no manual quota negotiation, no enterprise sales process, and no usage tier review. The category covers both general web search and targeted content extraction.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Exa - <strong>Neural web search API</strong> - <a href="https://exa.ai">Website</a></summary>

Neural web search API designed for LLMs, with semantic matching, live-crawled content, and similarity queries.

Exa indexed the web the way an agent wants to search it. Instead of matching keywords, it matches meaning, and the content it returns is the actual page text, not a search-result snippet. For a research agent pulling primary sources, Exa is the search layer that makes the rest of the pipeline work.

<summary>Firecrawl - <strong>Web scraping and crawling API</strong> ⭐ 107.6k - <a href="https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl">GitHub</a></summary>

Scrape any website into clean markdown or structured data with a single API call, including JS-rendered pages.

The 'turn a URL into readable markdown' service that agents actually use. Firecrawl handles JavaScript rendering, rate limiting, and format conversion in one call. When the agent needs the content of a specific page and not a search result summary, this is the tool. Open source core; managed tier for when the crawl gets serious.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [Firecrawl](https://firecrawl.dev) · **Docs:** [https://docs.firecrawl.dev](https://docs.firecrawl.dev) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl](https://github.com/mendableai/firecrawl) · **Open source**

<summary>Linkup - <strong>Real-time search API for agents</strong> - <a href="https://www.linkup.so">Website</a></summary>

Search API designed for agent consumption, returning ranked results with deep-content extraction and source attribution from the live web.

Linkup is purpose-built for agents that need to ground a response in fresh web data without scraping. The response shape returns ranked sources with content blocks the model can read directly, and supports deep-content extraction so the agent does not have to fetch + parse pages separately. A French startup that has been gaining traction as a Tavily alternative; the editorial copy and API ergonomics show a real focus on agent workflows rather than retrofitting human-first search.

<summary>Tavily - <strong>Search API for AI agents</strong> - <a href="https://tavily.com">Website</a></summary>

Search API built specifically for AI agents with grounded answers, source citations, and news search.

Tavily is the search API that picks up the phone. Cleanest developer experience in the category, a free tier generous enough to build on, and the responses are shaped for agent consumption from the first byte. When a newer agent framework says 'add web search', the default is almost always Tavily.

<summary>Brave Search API - <strong>Independent web index, REST search</strong> - <a href="https://brave.com/search/api">Website</a></summary>

Search API backed by Brave's own crawled index, not a Bing or Google reseller. Three tiers: free for low-volume agents, pro for higher throughput, AI tier for embed and re-ranking heavy workflows.

The independence angle matters. When an agent's retrieval needs are sensitive to whatever Bing or Google decides to filter that day, an unaffiliated index becomes infrastructure. Result objects are clean JSON, latency is competitive, and rate limits start permissive enough to build a real product without upgrading immediately.

## Scheduling and Orchestration (4)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

Tools that handle when agent work runs and whether it actually completed. Agents that need to fire tasks later, retry on failure, or verify outcomes after the fact need a layer that does this for them rather than reinventing it inside every agent. The bar is full programmatic registration of jobs and outcome reporting through APIs, with no dashboard-only configuration steps.

</details>

<details>
<summary>CueAPI - <strong>Accountability API for agents</strong> ⭐ 5 - <a href="https://github.com/cueapi/cueapi-core">GitHub</a></summary>

Scheduling and execution accountability API for AI agents with verified outcomes and retries.

Cron fires jobs. Cue knows whether they succeeded. The distinction matters the moment an agent schedules work: delivery confirmation is not the same as outcome verification. CueAPI sits underneath agents that have to do something later and confirm it got done, with native retries and exponential backoff on failure. Open source under Apache 2.0 for teams that want to self-host.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [CueAPI](https://cueapi.ai) · **Docs:** [https://docs.cueapi.ai](https://docs.cueapi.ai) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/cueapi/cueapi-core](https://github.com/cueapi/cueapi-core) · **Open source**

<summary>Inngest - <strong>Durable execution platform</strong> ⭐ 5.2k - <a href="https://github.com/inngest/inngest">GitHub</a></summary>

Durable execution platform for background jobs, AI workflows, and long-running agent steps.

Durable execution for agent workflows that cannot fit inside a single request. Inngest checkpoints every step, so when the agent crashes halfway through a multi-step job, it resumes at the last good state instead of starting over. Useful when the agent's job is measured in minutes, not seconds.

**Integration:** SDK · **Homepage:** [Inngest](https://inngest.com) · **Docs:** [https://www.inngest.com/docs](https://www.inngest.com/docs) · **GitHub:** [https://github.com/inngest/inngest](https://github.com/inngest/inngest) · **Open source**

</details>

<details>
<summary>Trigger.dev - <strong>Background jobs for AI</strong> ⭐ 14.5k - <a href="https://github.com/triggerdotdev/trigger.dev">GitHub</a></summary>

Background job platform with built-in AI task support, concurrency controls, and wait-until-event primitives.

Trigger.dev is the other shape of durable execution, leaning harder into AI-specific primitives. The wait-for-event model lets agents pause on a real-world condition (an email arrives, a webhook fires, a human approves) without holding a process open. Concurrency controls are first-class, which matters once your agent starts calling rate-limited APIs.

<details>
<summary>Hatchet - <strong>Durable task orchestration with DAGs</strong> ⭐ 5.6k - <a href="https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet">GitHub</a></summary>

Durable execution engine that runs workflows as code, with native step retries, fan-out/fan-in, and a typed step API. Self-host in Docker or run as Hatchet Cloud.

Sits in a useful gap between Inngest's event-first model and full DAG engines like Temporal — heavier than the former, lighter than the latter. The typed step API and the built-in concurrency primitives are the differentiators when an agent's workflow needs branching that's hard to express in a flat event handler. MIT-licensed at the core.

## Communication (3)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

APIs for agents to send messages outward to humans. Email, SMS, push notifications, anything where the agent's job ends with reaching a person. The category is small and likely to stay small because most communication infrastructure has human-gated setup steps — DNS records for email, carrier compliance for SMS, business verification for almost everything. Tools listed here have a fully programmatic setup path even if it requires multi-credential coordination across multiple services.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Resend - <strong>Transactional email API</strong> - <a href="https://resend.com">Website</a></summary>

Developer-first transactional email API with React Email integration and high deliverability.

The transactional email API that feels designed for agents to call rather than humans to configure. Clean SDK, sensible deliverability defaults, React Email templates that produce designer-quality output. Sending a custom-domain email requires DNS records for SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, but the entire flow is programmatic: POST to /domains to create the domain and receive the records, apply them through a DNS provider's API, then POST to /domains/{id}/verify to trigger async validation. Tier 2 passage on the programmatic-path test: needs DNS credentials alongside the Resend API key, but there is no human-gated step.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [Resend](https://resend.com) · **Docs:** [https://resend.com/docs](https://resend.com/docs)

</details>

<details>
<summary>SendGrid - <strong>Email delivery infrastructure</strong> - <a href="https://sendgrid.com">Website</a></summary>

Email delivery infrastructure for transactional and marketing mail at high volume.

For when the volume is high and the deliverability numbers matter. The incumbent holds the category because shipping a million emails a day without landing in spam is a genuinely hard problem, and SendGrid has solved it for longer than almost any competitor. Sending from a custom domain requires authenticated domain setup, but every step has a REST endpoint: create the domain, retrieve DNS records, push them through a DNS provider's API, then call the validate-authenticated-domain endpoint. Tier 2 passage on the programmatic-path test: needs DNS credentials alongside the SendGrid API key, but there is no human-gated step.

**Integration:** REST API · **Homepage:** [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) · **Docs:** [https://docs.sendgrid.com](https://docs.sendgrid.com)

<details>
<summary>Postmark - <strong>Transactional email with high deliverability</strong> - <a href="https://postmarkapp.com">Website</a></summary>

Transactional email API focused on inbox placement, not marketing volume. Fast bounce/spam reporting and a sandbox tier that lets agents test without a verified domain.

The pick when receipts, password resets, magic links, and operational alerts have to actually arrive. Postmark trades volume for reliability and the 99.99% historical uptime numbers back the claim. Like Resend and SendGrid, production sends require SPF/DKIM/DMARC on a custom domain — Tier 2 passage, programmatic via your DNS provider's API.

## Guardrails and Safety (2)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

Runtime infrastructure that an agent calls to keep itself out of trouble. Prompt-injection scanners, output content filters, jailbreak detectors, and policy gates that sit between the agent's input and the model, or between the model's output and a downstream tool. Listed tools must let the agent call them programmatically from the first request — no human review of policy configs, no enterprise procurement gating the API key.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Lakera Guard - <strong>Runtime prompt-injection and content guardrails</strong> - <a href="https://www.lakera.ai/lakera-guard">Website</a></summary>

A scanning API an agent calls before passing user input to the model, and again before passing model output to a downstream tool. Trained on a large corpus of jailbreaks, prompt-injection patterns, and PII templates, with low-latency calls that don't break the agent's loop.

Most agent frameworks have nothing on the input side. Lakera is the closest thing to a default. Self-serve signup with a free tier, REST endpoints for `/guard` (input scanning) and `/guard-output` (output scanning), and policy customization via the dashboard or the API itself. Worth pairing with a structured-output validator on the model side; together they cover both ends of the prompt-to-tool path.

<details>
<summary>Guardrails AI - <strong>Validators for LLM I/O, OSS + Hub</strong> ⭐ 4.6k - <a href="https://github.com/guardrails-ai/guardrails">GitHub</a></summary>

Open-source framework for adding runtime validators around LLM input and output, with a Hub of pre-built validators for PII detection, jailbreak attempts, hallucination checks, and structured-output enforcement.

The library-first answer to the guardrails problem. An agent imports the SDK, wraps the model call, and gets a validated response or a structured error it can branch on. Pairs well with Lakera Guard: Lakera handles the network-side scanning, Guardrails AI handles the in-process validation and the structured-output contract. The Hub adds plug-in validators without forcing custom code, which is what makes the library a real default rather than a research toy.

## Credentials and Tool Management (3)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

Layers that let agents authenticate to external services without human-in-the-loop credential exchange. The agent needs API keys, OAuth tokens, or service accounts for tools beyond its core stack, and these tools manage the credential lifecycle programmatically. The bar is full agent-driven credential issuance and rotation through APIs, with no human approval flows for individual integrations.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Arcade AI - <strong>Authenticated tool-calling platform</strong> - <a href="https://arcade.dev">Website</a></summary>

Authenticated tool-calling platform for agents with permissioned actions and per-user credential storage.

Arcade's bet is that tool-calling is not complete until the auth story is. Agents get a tool catalog, but every call goes through Arcade's auth layer, which means the model never sees a raw credential and the user can revoke scopes without redeploying the agent. Useful when the agent is operating on behalf of humans with real permissions.

<summary>Composio - <strong>Managed OAuth and integrations</strong> ⭐ 27.7k - <a href="https://github.com/ComposioHQ/composio">GitHub</a></summary>

Tool and credential management platform for AI agents with 250+ pre-built integrations and OAuth handling.

Agents that need to act on behalf of a user hit OAuth the moment they try to do anything useful. Composio solves the tool-and-credential problem with a pre-built catalog of integrations that handles auth, refresh, and scope management. The agent calls a named tool; Composio makes sure the right user's token is in place.

<summary>Metorial - <strong>Managed MCP server hosting</strong> - <a href="https://metorial.com">Website</a></summary>

Managed MCP and tool-use platform for AI agents with credential vaulting and usage analytics.

The MCP-native answer in this category. Metorial hosts your MCP servers, vaults the credentials they need, and hands the agent a single connection instead of a sprawl. For teams standardizing on MCP as the tool-calling substrate, this is the control plane.

## MCP Ecosystem (4)

<details>
<summary>What this category is for</summary>

Tools and registries built around the Model Context Protocol — the open standard for connecting agents to external capabilities. MCP servers expose specific tools to agents through a uniform interface, and registries help agents discover what's available. The bar is the same as everywhere else in the Index: an agent must be able to install, register, and use the server through a programmatic path.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Context7 - <strong>Live documentation MCP server</strong> ⭐ 52.4k - <a href="https://github.com/upstash/context7">GitHub</a></summary>

MCP server that feeds agents up-to-date library documentation and code examples from the source.

Coding agents keep hallucinating APIs that do not exist because their training data froze before the library's last breaking change. Context7 is the fix: an MCP server that pulls the current docs at call time, so when an agent asks 'how do I use this library', the answer matches reality. Simple idea; outsized impact on agent code quality.

<summary>Model Context Protocol - <strong>MCP standard and reference servers</strong> ⭐ 83.5k - <a href="https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers">GitHub</a></summary>

Open standard for connecting AI agents to tools and data sources, with a reference server collection.

The protocol under a lot of the rest of this list. MCP defined the shape of how an agent discovers and calls a tool, and the reference servers repo is where the official integrations live (Postgres, GitHub, Slack, Filesystem, and dozens more). When a tool says 'MCP-compatible', it is promising the shape these servers define.

<summary>Smithery - <strong>MCP server registry</strong> - <a href="https://smithery.ai">Website</a></summary>

MCP server registry and hosting with one-click install for Claude, Cursor, and other MCP clients.

The registry layer on top of the MCP ecosystem. Smithery catalogs every known MCP server, handles discovery, and offers hosted execution so you do not have to run the server yourself. For agents picking tools at runtime, Smithery is the closest thing the MCP world has to an App Store.

<summary>TWZRD Agent Intel - <strong>On-chain trust scoring MCP server for Solana agent wallets</strong> - <a href="https://intel.twzrd.xyz">Website</a></summary>

MCP server that scores AI agent wallets on Solana for trust and reputation before cross-agent interactions or x402 micropayments.

When autonomous agents need to interact with or pay unknown wallets, there is no way to know whether the counterparty is legitimate without external verification. TWZRD solves this: an MCP server that queries on-chain transaction history, behavioral patterns, and wallet age to return a trust score (0-100) and a go/no-go preflight check. The get_trust_receipt tool issues a cryptographically-signed receipt for audit trails, paid via x402 micropayment.
